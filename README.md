# Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Learning to Detect Retinal Vessels in Fundus Images

Vision impairment due to pathological damage of the retina can largely be prevented through periodic screening using fundus color imaging. However the challenge with large scale screening is the inability to exhaustively detect fine blood vessels crucial to disease diagnosis. This work presents a computational imaging framework using deep and ensemble learning for reliable detection of blood vessels in fundus color images. An ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks is trained to segment vessel and non-vessel areas of a color fundus image. During inference, the responses of the individual ConvNets of the ensemble are averaged to form the final segmentation. In experimental evaluation with the DRIVE database, we achieve the objective of vessel detection with maximum average accuracy of 91.8% (This accuracy is different from the accuracy reported in the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04833) because of different libraries used) and Kappa Score of 0.7031.

## Proposed Method

**Ensemble learning** is a technique of using multiple models or experts for solving a particular artificial intelligence problem. Ensemble methods seek to promote diversity among the models they combine and reduce the problem related to overfitting of the training data. The outputs of the individual models of the ensemble are combined (e.g. by averaging) to form the final prediction.

**Convolutional neural networks** (CNN or ConvNet) are a special category of artificial neural networks designed for processing data with a gridlike structure. The ConvNet architecture is based on sparse interactions and parameter sharing and is highly effective for efficient learning of spatial invariances in images. There are four kinds of layers in a typical ConvNet architecture: convolutional (conv), pooling (pool), fullyconnected (affine) and rectifying linear unit (ReLU). Each convolutional layer transforms one set of feature maps into another set of feature maps by convolution with a set of filters.

This paper makes an attempt to ameliorate the issue of subjectivity induced bias in feature representation by training an ensemble of 12 Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) on raw color fundus images to discriminate vessel pixels from non-vessel ones. 

**Dataset**: The ensemble of ConvNets is evaluated by learning with the DRIVE training set (image id. 21-40) and
testing over the DRIVE test set (image id. 1-20). 

**Learning mechanism**: Each ConvNet is trained independently on a set of 120000 randomly chosen 3×31×31 patches.
Learning rate was kept constant across models at 5e − 4. Dropout probability and number of hidden units in
the penultimate affine layer of the different models were sampled respectively from U ([0.5, 0.9]) and U ({128, 256, 512}) where U(.) denotes uniform probability distribution over a given range. The models were trained using Adam algorithm with minibatch size 256. Some of these parameters are different from the paper. The user can set some of these parameters using command line arguments which is explained in later sections.

## Architecture

The ConvNets have the same organization of layers which can be described as: 

**input- [conv - relu]-[conv - relu - pool] x 2 - affine - relu - [affine with dropout] - softmax**

(Schematic representation below)

The system was trained on a machine with dual Intel Xeon E5-2630 v2 CPUs, 32 GB RAM and NVIDIA Tesla K-20C GPU. Average training time for each model was 3.5 hours (for 10000 epochs). Average inference time for each image was 55 secs on the said machine.

 **Note** that in the 3rd image the blood vessels are not easily visible to the human eye but our network does a good job at discerning the fine structure of the vessel.

 The Ensemble of ConvNets efficiently captures the underlying statistics that govern the degree of vesselness of a point in a color fundus image. This is particularly demonstrated in the 4th row, where the Ensemble detects a clinically important condition called [Neovascularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neovascularization) (which we got verified by multiple ophthalmologists) not marked in the ground truth.

<hr>

### Configuration

The ```arglists/``` folder contains JSON files that store necessary command line arguments. It is human readable and hence can be edited easily by a user. 

##### heavy.json

 This is necessary for training the ensemble and needs to be passed to ```train_ensemble.py```. It contains the list of arguments that needs to be passed to ```v2_graph.py``` for every model. As the name suggests, this configuration took us 2 days to run on a server, and unless you have a powerful GPU, I would suggest editing this file before running it.

##### model\_paths_heavy.json

The models saved by training the ensemble are saved as checkpoints. This is a simple file that stores the paths to the best checkpoints for each model.
